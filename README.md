# TCG Pack Opener

Language: Java

Brief description:

Create a TCG Pack Opener. It should be an application where you can choose from options in the menu:

- Open Pack
- View Owned Cards

### Open Pack

The user will get random cards from the existing database and will pull cards based on rarity.

### Rarity

Cards come in three different rarities:

- Common
- Rare
- Ultra Rare

Every common card can be pulled in the other rarities. Some other cards may only exist in Rare+ or possibly even Ultra Rare only rarity. This system should be designed in a way so that other rarities may be introduced in the future.

### View Owned Cards

It should display the currently owned cards including a sort and search function.

The application should be built in a way so that the possibility of future deck-building, playing against other players etc. exists.
